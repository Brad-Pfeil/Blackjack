# Blackjack
developed a version of the popular card game "blackjack" in MATLAB. The program runs a game between the user and dealer (computer) in the MATLAB command window utilising ASCII art. The player was able to perform different actions and bet money based on their current pot. Developed incrementally and unit tested to ensure the program would not crash when given invalid input.
